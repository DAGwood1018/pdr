<p><a href="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/full/ara7ke.jpg"><img src="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/ara7ke.jpg" alt="Ayushi Ambhore" /></a> Hi guys! My name is Ayushi and I’m a second year CS major in the College. This is my first semester TAing 2150. When I took this course I probably attended OH more than 100 times, so I’m excited to help you all the same way other TA’s helped me! When I’m not in office hours, I’m either participating in WiCS &amp; GWC here on grounds or reading conspiracy theories and visiting new places. Really looking forward to meeting you guys this semester :) <br clear="all"></p>

Outside of school, I’m part of Flux, a UVA poetry and spoken word club, and the Mcintire Investment Institute. I like Avatar the Last Airbender, the Fallout games, jogging, and most of all, Spikeball! A fun fact about me is that I built a folding table over the summer.

<p><a href="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/full/jmm3vn.jpg"><img src="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/jmm3vn.jpg" alt="Josh Mehr" /></a> What’s up! I’m a second-year BSCS major from Woodbridge Virginia (place in NOVA that has an Ikea). I doubt anyone that reads this cares about me liking dogs so I won’t bother talking about stuff like that. This will be my first time TAing for any class. I’m incredibly excited to help you work your way through this class. It can be daunting sometimes but as long as you don’t give up and are willing to ask for help you’ll be just fine! Let me just assure you that if you need any help I’ll try my best to help you in whatever way I possibly can because I remember how grateful I was to have such helpful TAs when I took 2150. I hope we have a fantastic semester together! <br clear="all"></p>

<p>
<p>Outside the classroom I play the trumpet in the Cavalier Marching Band, which has given me so many amazing experiences, like watching Mamadi Diakite sink the game tying buzzer beater against Purdue! I also enjoy the outdoors and am part of the Rock Climbing Team. I hope I get to meet many of you guys this year! <br clear="all"></p>

I’m Lucy, and I am a second year CS and statistics major from NOVA. 2150 has been my favorite class I have taken so far, and although it may be stressful and challenging at times, all of the work was very well worth the effort and I promise you will make it through and think the same :)
<p>
Outside of class, I enjoy playing volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and going on walks/runs. I love cafes/bakeries and I would (ideally) like to open my own bakery one day! My favorite pastries are donuts and cinnamon rolls so let me know if you have any (easy) recipes!

I knew I wanted to TA CS 2150 the moment I was inspired by Binky’s Pointer Fun, and I guess I really like helping people too.
<p>
<p>I play club water polo here for fun, so if you’re ever looking for a new activity to try let me know! My favorite movie is Inception, and my favorite jelly bean flavor is anything but buttered popcorn. I’m excited to work with you all and hope you have a great semester!" <br clear="all"></p>
