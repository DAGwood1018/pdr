Hi guys! My name is Ayushi and I'm a second year CS major in the College. This is my first semester TAing 2150. When I took this course I probably attended OH more than 100 times, so I'm excited to help you all the same way other TA's helped me! When I'm not in office hours, I'm either participating in WiCS & GWC here on grounds or reading conspiracy theories and visiting new places. Really looking forward to meeting you guys this semester :)

I'm a second year Computer Science major and this is my first semester TAing this class! I'm really interested in data science, cooking/eating, and art. I'm also a part of SWE, A.O.E., and WiCS. I'm a TA because it can be really rewarding, and I loved CS 2150 as a student.

Hey Friends! My name is AJ Cuddeback and I'm a second year from Medford, Massachusetts studying computer engineering and physics. Outside of TAing and classes, I do physics research, resident-advise a first year dorm, and an officer in Outdoors at UVa. I'm really into my chacos, and my diet primarily subsets of peanut butter Clif bars and Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I am also emotionally attached to my Nalgene. If you're not sure where I am, you can probably find me climbing at Slaughter or scooping up deals at the local Goodwill. Like Dwight Schrute, I always keep an extra set of Birkenstocks in the car for special occasions.

Outside of school, I'm part of Flux, a UVA poetry and spoken word club, and the Mcintire Investment Institute. I like Avatar the Last Airbender, the Fallout games, jogging, and most of all, Spikeball! A fun fact about me is that I built a folding table over the summer. Hit me up if you wanna talk about literally anything and lets have a great semester!

## Josh Mehr

What's up! I'm a second-year BSCS major from Woodbridge Virginia (place in NOVA that has an Ikea). I doubt anyone that reads this cares about me liking dogs so I won't bother talking about stuff like that. This will be my first time TAing for any class. I'm incredibly excited to help you work your way through this class. It can be daunting sometimes but as long as you don't give up and are willing to ask for help you'll be just fine! Let me just assure you that if you need any help I'll try my best to help you in whatever way I possibly can because I remember how grateful I was to have such helpful TAs when I took 2150. I hope we have a fantastic semester together!

Hi everyone! I'm a third year computer engineering major and this is my first semester TAing 2150. I became a TA for this class because it's my favorite class I have taken and I love helping people.

I have a passion for education (this is the 5th class I'll be a TA for) and I'm particularly excited to TA 2150 this year as I believe the content of this class is at the core of Computer Science.<p>Outside the classroom I play the trumpet in the Cavalier Marching Band, which has given me so many amazing experiences, like watching Mamadi Diakite sink the game tying buzzer beater against Purdue! I also enjoy the outdoors and am part of the Rock Climbing Team. I hope I get to meet many of you guys this year!

"Hello! I'm a 2nd year CS major and French minor and this is my first semester TA-ing for 2150. I really enjoyed this course so I thought it would be nice to revisit it and help others in the same way TA's have helped me. In the realm of CS, I'm really interested in learning more about AI and ML but ultimately I want to work in game design! I'm also an artist who loves learning languages. I look forward to meeting you all!

Hello! I'm Lucy, and I am a second year CS and statistics major from NOVA. 2150 has been my favorite class I have taken so far, and although it may be stressful and challenging at times, all of the work was very well worth the effort and I promise you will make it through and think the same  :) <p>Outside of class, I enjoy playing volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and going on walks/runs. I love cafes/bakeries and I would (ideally) like to open my own bakery one day! My favorite pastries are donuts and cinnamon rolls so let me know if you have any (easy) recipes!<p>I am excited to work with you all this semester and feel free to reach out if you have any question!

Hey everyone, welcome to CS2150! I'm a 4th year CS and Econ major who's really excited to finally TA for this course - it is the one I learned the most in and will also truly prepare all of you for just about every CS course afterwards. While I don't have many extracurriculars outside of class, I'm pretty involved with different jobs across grounds. This class may seem/feel/be a bit overwhelming at times, but at the end you will realize it was all necessary. And some of you will truly appreciate C++ over other languages after this :) I look forward to helping you all this semester!

Hi everyone! I'm a second-year CS/CpE double major. I knew I wanted to TA CS 2150 the moment I was inspired by Binky's Pointer Fun, and I guess I really like helping people too.<p>I play club water polo here for fun, so if you're ever looking for a new activity to try let me know! My favorite movie is Inception, and my favorite jelly bean flavor is anything but buttered popcorn. I'm excited to work with you all and hope you have a great semester!"
